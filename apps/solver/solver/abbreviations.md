## Abbreviations and Symbols

Following is the system of abbreviations and symbols used in the course listings that appear throughout this Bulletin. Part of each course number is an alphabetical prefix that indicates the University school, college, or program (first three letters) and the department (next two letters) in which the course originates. For example, CAS HI 102 indicates a course in the College of Arts & Sciences, Department of History. The alphabetical prefixes used in this Bulletin are explained in a table below. The number indicates the course’s level of difficulty. A general guide follows. Should a school or college attach more specific meanings or stipulations to the numerical level, these will be explained in that school’s section of the Bulletin.

000–099: Nondegree, no units
100–199: General undergraduate
200–299: Intermediate undergraduate
300–399: Advanced undergraduate
400–599: Advanced undergraduate and/or graduate level
600–799: General graduate
800–899: Advanced graduate
900–999: Graduate directed study, research, continuing study status

An X after a course number indicates that the course is given off campus. Course descriptions usually offer a brief outline of the content of the course, any prerequisites or corequisites, the instructor, unit value, and term the course is offered. Abbreviations frequently used are:

Prereq: Prerequisite
Coreq: Corequisite

Not offered means that the course is not offered during the current academic year but may be offered in the future. Offered irregularly means that the course is offered only if there is sufficient demand.
